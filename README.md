## 📌 Executive Summary

This project investigates how academic stress impacts mental health among Egyptian university students. Using survey responses, we analyzed depression levels, stress intensity, and emotional expression comfort. The findings highlight major mental health risks and propose institutional recommendations to improve student well-being.

## 🏆 Project Objectives

- Assess depression using PHQ-9 scores and self-reported stress.
- Examine links between academic/social factors and mental health.
- Analyze expression comfort and its impact on coping.
- Provide actionable insights for university mental health support.
