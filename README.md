## 📌 Executive Summary

This project aims to analyze the impact of academic stress on the mental health of Egyptian university students. By leveraging survey data and statistical analysis, the study identifies key factors affecting students' mental health, including demographic variables, academic workload, and employment status.

## 🏆 Project Objectives

- Assess the levels of academic stress among Egyptian university students.
- Examine the differences in stress levels based on gender, academic level, and field of study.
- Investigate the relationship between academic workload, employment status, and mental health challenges.
- Provide empirical data to support mental health awareness and intervention programs.
- Help universities develop strategies to reduce academic stress and improve student well-being.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

🔗 **Survey Link:** [Academic Stress & Mental Health Survey]([https://forms.gle/jNARfRByFCvCjHtk8](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdpt0wL3WpQgHXFry_B73VK-ovqNqSSkeV8Yfh5yMcqI5-GYw/viewform?usp=dialog))

The study is based on data collected from a cross-sectional online survey (Google Form) conducted on Egyptian university students enrolled in Bachelor's, Diploma, Master's, and Ph.D. programs. The survey included:

- **Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)** for depression assessment.
- **Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)** to measure stress levels.
- **Academic Stress Scale** to evaluate stressors related to coursework and exams.

## 📝 Project Questions 

#### **Main Project Question:**

- What is The Impact of Academic Stress on Mental Health Among Egyptian University Students?

#### **Sub-Questions:**

- What is the average level of academic stress among Egyptian university students?
- How do stress levels differ between male and female students?
- How do stress levels vary across different academic levels (Bachelor’s, Diploma, Master’s, and Ph.D.)?
- Do students who work while studying experience higher stress levels compared to those who do not work?
- How does the interaction between field of study and employment status relate to academic stress levels?
- To what extent does academic workload (measured by study hours per week) impact students’ mental health?
