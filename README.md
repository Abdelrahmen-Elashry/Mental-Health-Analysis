## 📌 Executive Summary

This project analyzes the impact of academic stress on the mental health of Egyptian university students using survey data, statistical analysis, and interactive dashboards. It identifies key factors such as demographic variables, workload, and social support, offering recommendations for institutional intervention.

## 🏆 Project Objectives

- Measure depression using PHQ-9 scores and stress levels.
- Explore how academic, demographic, and social factors relate to mental health.
- Understand students' comfort in expressing emotions.
- Provide recommendations for universities to improve mental health support.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

🔗 **Survey Link:** [Academic Stress & Mental Health Survey](https://forms.gle/uexw33saHBJL1rqn7)

The dataset contains responses from Egyptian university students across different degrees (Bachelor’s, Diploma, Master’s, Ph.D.) covering:

- **PHQ-9 Depression Scores**  
- **Self-reported Stress Levels**  
- **Expression Comfort with Family, Friends, and Professionals**  
- **Demographic and Academic Data**

## 📝 Project Questions

- What is the relationship between academic stress and mental health (PHQ-9, stress scores)?
- Which factors (e.g., gender, academic level, social support) contribute most to stress?
- How comfortable are students expressing emotions, and how does this affect coping?
- What barriers exist to seeking help?
- What can universities do to reduce academic stress?
